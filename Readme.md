### Preparation

Social Media Analysis based profiling system is a profiling system that profiles users, persons based on their intersts, relationships, activities, and public infos on their social media accounts, in the age of data it's essential to know how to use the public and allowed data in order to enhance our industries, a company which use this concept is called Data-Driven-Company, one of operations that appears specially in marketing and hr levels is called Data-Based-Profiling which means to label a user with special attributes that represent some domain specific characteristic, where this profiling happens based on other activites or inputs about the user / person.

## Installation

## Usage
The system is exposed via a RESTful API built with Flask and served using a WSGI server.

Start the server and access the interactive API documentation at:

👉 http://localhost:8000/docs

The documentation includes:
- Available endpoints
- Request and response schemas
- Example payloads
- Error codes

## 3. System Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Collect raw datasets from **Facebook**, **Last.fm**, and other social networks.
   - Store them in `data/storage/raw`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and normalize user IDs, event IDs, and relationships.
   - Prepare datasets for graph ingestion in `src/preprocessing`.

3. **Graph Construction**
   - Load nodes and relationships into **Neo4j**:
     - `(User)-[:ATTENDED]->(Event)`
     - `(User)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(User)` (optional)
   - Additional metadata from `infoExtra` can enrich the graph.

4. **Feature Computation**
   - Node-level metrics: degree, centrality.
   - Edge-level metrics: similarity, co-attendance.
   - Tools: **NetworkX**, **GDS**.

5. **Graph Analytics & Profiling**
   - Community detection: `gds.louvain`
   - Node similarity: `gds.nodeSimilarity`
   - Embeddings: `gds.fastRP`
   - Predictive profiling: scikit-learn / TensorFlow models.

6. **Evaluation & Monitoring**
   - Validate profiling accuracy.
   - Log pipeline and model performance in `logs/logs_records`.
   - Monitor pipelines and analytics via `monitoring`.

7. **Interface**
   - CLI (`main.py`) or API (`api`) for:
     - Querying profiles
     - Running analyses
     - Generating reports

## 6. Key Architectural Principles

- **Separation of Concerns** — independent modules for ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, and monitoring.
- **Graph-centric design** — optimized for social network analytics using Neo4j and GDS.
- **Data-driven profiling** — user labels and insights derived from activity and relationships.
- **Extensible & modular** — easy to add datasets, models, or analytics pipelines.
- **Notebook-friendly** — supports exploratory analysis and reporting in Jupyter.
